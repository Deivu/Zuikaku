### A very lightweight wrapper around osu! api.

### Usage.
Refer to [`Client.js`](https://github.com/Deivu/Zuikaku/blob/master/test/Client.js) 

### This API mostly follow the parameters found in osu! api wiki with the exception of you dont need to provide the api key in every request like how it is presented on example.

You can find the wiki in [`HERE`](https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/wiki) 

### NOTE
> This is in development but stable enough to be on production and I would add some minor features in future.
